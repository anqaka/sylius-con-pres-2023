# Accessibility

## What Web accessibility is?

<v-click>

Web accessibility (A11y) is the inclusive practice of ensuring that there are no barriers that prevent interaction with a website or an app. So a website is operable and available for all users, no matter what their conditions are.

# Implementation

<v-clicks>

<Card>We can quickly add accessibility before the release</Card>

<Card position="right">Accessibility is like a feature - you do it once and then you have it</Card>

<Card>Accessibility can be fixed by the accessibility overlay</Card>


</v-clicks>

<v-click>

<False />

</v-click>


<!-- 1. Won't work. Maybe easy things such as alternative text or form labeling may be added at the end, but some complex UX components should be planned to be accessible. In some cases, making features accessible at the end of development process may require the full refactoring.
2. To be accessible you need to check and monitor your accessibility. It can be broken easily by updating the content or implementing a new feature
3. A11y overlay it's a plugin that in theory helps users adjust your site and use assistive technologies easily. The practice is different - it enables some customization that already available in your system settings (colors contrast, font size etc) and it cannot fix serious a11y issues - link missing alt text or wrong semantics. It can also violate the privacy policy by collecting user data without their consent and can break default assistive technology navigation.
